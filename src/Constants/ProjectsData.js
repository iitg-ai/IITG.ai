    description:
      "This project aims to generate images from audio or text provided by the user as an application for the latest OpenAl Tools in the order of Whisper, ChatGPT, and DALL-E. The pipeline involves multi models for each process and has been fine-tuned for each task. The text input is also addressed by summarising it to create a prompt that further makes images using stable diffusion.",
